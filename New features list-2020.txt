        Best solution? Design compromise between button and TOC: https://codepen.io/Novicell/pen/oLrOrB
        Like the idea of word on sticky button: https://codepen.io/avanzac/pen/zJJvrP
        Like the expansion animation: https://codepen.io/vcmg/pen/Pqmgdz?editors=0100

        Panel expansion idea: https://codepen.io/timothylong/details/yNMpqx
        Elegent FAB, but perhaps UX not the best: https://codepen.io/sashatran/pen/pRpmWG

    Thoughts: use the button style, because there is no need to take much space with a TOC-style nav.
      However, it is important that the button purpose and visibility be clear to visitors.
  - DONE consider smaller hero image. 
    SOLUTION: kept About page with Section Front hero image, used CSS to shorten hero image whilst the page
    is in 'Section Front' format.
    Graduate Program Overview, Research Projects, and CAAPP pages are all in Secondary Page format.
