			<h3>Tracking light wavelength quality</h3>
			<p>Cyanos sink or float in water to position themselves favorably in their environments, and the surrounding light quality varies with depth.<br />
				For example, on the surface, cyanos are exposed to rich amounts of red light. As they sink deeper, red light grows scarcer while green light remains abundant. Cyanos constantly track light quality and <a href="https://prl.natsci.msu.edu/news-events/news/montgomery-publishes-on-light-harvesting-efficiency/">adjust themselves to capture the most available wavelength at any time</a>.<br />
				It is it like dialing your car radio to the exact frequency to capture the waves coming from your favorite stations. But you can only tune to stations available at your location.</p>

			<h3>Photosynthetic factories that produce food</h3>
			<p>Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide, taken from the air, to produce energy molecules that power the cyanos. <a href="https://prl.natsci.msu.edu/news-events/news/how-to-build-an-artificial-nano-factory-to-power-our-futures/">This step takes place in nanofactories called carboxysomes</a>.</p>
