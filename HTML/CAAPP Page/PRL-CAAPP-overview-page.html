	<h2>What we do</h2>
	<p class="prl-p-subheader-smaller">We are facing unprecedented challenges that directly involve the plant sciences. 
		The United Nations estimates that food production has to increase by at least 70% over the next 30-50 years. 
		So, there is an urgent need to develop highly productive and sustainable food production sources. 
		Our center's technologies can measure photosynthetic parameters, in real-time, and identify biophysical processes 
		and genes that contribute to photosynthetic efficiency and productivity.</p>

			<h3>DEPI Chambers</h3>
			<p class="prl-p-subheader-smaller">Dynamic Environmental Photosynthetic Imaging (DEPI) captures the types of 
				environmental conditions seen in the field, such as light intensities or weather patterns, and replays them in the lab. 
				Onboard cameras detect and quantify visible signals produced in real time by plant photosynthetic processes.</p>

			<h3>PhotosynQ</h3>
			<p class="prl-p-subheader-smaller">Most plant research happens in highly controlled lab conditions. 
				Unfortunately, the plants that human beings care most about grow outside where weather, bugs, and animals 
				impact their well-being. PhotosynQ is a platform for measuring plant health at a fundamental level in the 
				field and collecting data across the world to create a global, open access dataset of plant activity.</p>

				Each ePBR can re-create environmental conditions such as temperature, light intensity, and CO2.</p>
