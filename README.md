# PRL Website
Custom code for Mura <br />
<strong>*UNDER CONSTRUCTION *</strong> <br />
<h2>CSS Folder</h2>
<p>The CSS folder contains all custom stylesheets for the PRL website. Instructions for modifying the code:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Modifications take place in the 'prlCustomCSS-2018.scss' file</strong>. This requires knowledge of SCSS programming language.</li>
  <li> <strong>Use an automated compile and minimize system as Mura only reads .css files </strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>'prlCustomCSS-2018.scss file' is automatically compiled into the 'prlCustomCSS-2018.css' file on each new change.</li>
      <li>Then, the 'prlCustomCSS-2018.css' file is automatically minimized into the 'prlCustomCSS-2018.min.css' file</li>
      <li> Finally, copy and paste the contents from the 'prlCustomCSS-2018.min.css' file into Mura's dedicated custom CSS file. To do that, go to Mura's back end, go to the File Manager, then go to prl_User_Assets/File/websiteTheme/prlCustomCSS.css. Right click and choose 'Edit' under the 'prlCustomCSS.css' file and paste the code.</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
    
    Include locations of files (Ex: prl card markup under the website Branding guidelines section; homepage html is for brands section)
